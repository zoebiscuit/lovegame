# Intro
<br/>What your project is/does (and what it's called) <br/>
Love's Golden Toll is the name of the project. You are traveling with a character named Billy and he wants to purchase an expensive gift to a impress someone. However, he needs to sacrific ehis gold to progress through the trip. You do this by click on the ground where you want the gold to be to pass obstacles.<br/><br/>
Why you made your project <br/>
I made this project with my twin sister for the DayDream Game Jam.<br/><br/>
How you made your project <br/>
I made this game in Godot for the DayDream Game Jam. I spent 14 hours programming and learning GDScript during the event. I worked collaboratively with my twin sister who created the visuals for the game. <br/><br/>
What you struggled with and what you learned<br/>
I struggled a lot with the concept of global and local files. I needed this to program the Gold amount and keep it consistent throughout the different scenes. I have learned basic GDScript to program simple games. :)
